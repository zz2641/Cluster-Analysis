In this assignment we will be applying the K-means clustering algorithm. At the following link you can find a description of K-means:

https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/Applets/cluster.html


```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(klaR)
```

Now, upload the file "Class_Motivation.csv" from the Assignment 3 Repository as a data frame called "K1""
```{r}
K1 <- read.csv("Class_Motivation.csv",header = TRUE,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

This file contains the self-reported motivation scores for a class over five weeks. We are going to look for patterns in motivation over this time and sort people into clusters based on those patterns.

!!But before we do that, we will need to manipulate the data frame into a structure that can be analyzed by our clustering algorithm.!!!

The algorithm will treat each row as a value belonging to a person, so we need to remove the id variable.

```{r}
K2 <- K1[,-1]
```

It is important to think about the !!meaning of missing values when clustering!!!. We could treat them as having meaning or we could remove those people who have them. Neither option is ideal. What problems do we foresee if we recode or remove these values? 

Problem for either way:
1.remove: the sample size will be affected, losing representation
2.retain: the estimated values could contribute statistical significance in a wrong way.


After balancing the pros and cons of either way, we decided to remove people with missing values for this assignment.


```{r}
K3 <- na.omit(K2) #This command create a data frame with only those people with no missing values. It "omits" all rows with missing values, also known as a "listwise deletion". EG - It runs down the list deleting rows as it goes.
```

Another pre-processing step used in K-means is to !!standardize the values !!so that they have the same range. We do this because we want to !!treat each week as equally important!!! - if we do not standardise then the week with the largest range will have the greatest impact on which clusters are formed. We standardise the values by using the "scale()" command.

```{r}
K3 <- scale(K3) # scales the columns! to erase the differences incurred by individual differences
```


Now we will run the K-means clustering algorithm
1) The algorithm starts by randomly choosing some starting values 
2) Associates all observations near to those values with them
3) Calculates the mean of those clusters of values
4) Selects the observation closest to the mean of the cluster
5) Re-associates all observations closest to this observation
6) Continues this process until the clusters are no longer changing


Also, we need to choose the number of clusters we think are in the data. We will start with 2.

```{r}
fit <- kmeans(K3, 2)
#We have created an object called "fit" that contains all the details of our clustering including which observations belong to each cluster.
#We can access the list of clusters by typing "fit$cluster", the top row corresponds to the original order the rows were in. Notice we have deleted some rows.
fit$cluster
#We can also attach these clusters to the original dataframe by using the "data.frame" command to create a new data frame called K4.
K4<-data.frame(K3,fit$cluster)
#Have a look at the K4 dataframe. Lets change the names of the variables to make it more convenient with the names() command.
names(K4)<- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "Cluster")
```

Now we need to visualize the clusters we have created. To do so we want to play with the structure of our data. What would be most useful would be if we could visualize average motivation by cluster, by week. To do this we will need to convert our data from wide to long format using pacakges, tidyr and dplyr!

First lets use tidyr to convert from wide to long format.
```{r}
K5 <- gather(K4,Week,Motivation,-Cluster)
```

Now lets use dplyr to average our motivation values by week and by cluster.

```{r}
K6 <- K5 %>%
  group_by(Week,Cluster)%>%
  summarise(mean(Motivation))
names(K6)<-c("Week","Cluster","Motivation")

#the average motivation in cluster 1 is above 0 while the counterpart in cluster 2 is below 0.
```

Now it's time to do some visualization: 

https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html

And you can see the range of available graphics in ggplot here:

http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html

We are going to create a line plot similar to the one created in the school dropout paper we looked at in class (Bowers, 2010). It will have motivation on the Y-axis and weeks on the X-axis. To do this we will want our weeks variables to be treated as a number, but because it was created from a variable name it is currently being treated as a character variable. You can see this if you click on the arrow on the left of K6 in the Data pane. Week is designated by "chr". To convert it to numeric, we use the as.numeric command. 

Likewise, since "cluster" is not numeric but rather a categorical label we want to convert it from an "integer" format to a "factor" format so that ggplot does not treat it as a number. We can do this with the as.factor() command.

```{r}
K6$Week <- as.numeric(K6$Week)
K6$Cluster <- as.factor(K6$Cluster)
```

Now we can plot our line plot using the ggplot command, "ggplot()".

- The first argument in a ggplot is the dataframe we are using: K6
- Next is what is called an aesthetic (aes), the aesthetic tells ggplot which variables to use and how to use them. Here we are using the variables "week" and "avg" on the x and y axes and we are going color these variables using the "cluster" variable
- Then we are going to tell ggplot which type of plot we want to use by specifiying a "geom()", in this case a line plot: geom_line()
- Finally we are going to clean up our axes labels: xlab("Week") & ylab("Average Motivation")

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(K6,aes(x=Week,y=Motivation,color=Cluster))+
  geom_line()+
  xlab("Week")+
  ylab("Average Motivation")
```

What patterns do we see in the plot?

The average motivation in cluster 1 is above 0 while the counterpart in cluster 2 is below 0. At large, average motivation fluctuate week by week.

It would be useful to determine how many people are in each cluster. We can do this easily with dplyr.

```{r}
K7 <- table(K4$Cluster)
K7
#we have 16 students in cluster 1 and 7 in cluster 2
```

Look at the number of people in each cluster, now repeat this process for 3 rather than 2 clusters. Which cluster grouping is more informative? 

```{r}
fit1 <- kmeans(K3, 3)#after scaling, make K=3, creating 3 clusters for this data
fit1$cluster #checking for the allocation of the data
#attach these clusters to the original dataframe by using the "data.frame" command to create a new data frame called KK4.
KK4<-data.frame(K3,fit1$cluster)
#change the names of the variables to make it more convenient with the names() command.
names(KK4)<- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "Cluster")
KK5 <- gather(KK4,Week,Motivation,-Cluster)
# THE VARIBALE WEEK HERE IS CHARACTER,due to the "gather" function from "motivation1", and CLUSTER IS NUMERIC
#average our motivation values by week and by cluster
KK6 <- KK5 %>%
  group_by(Week,Cluster)%>%
  summarise(mean(Motivation))
#renaming the columns since the results above had a controversial column name as mean(Motivation) which will affect the follwing ploting in ggplot
names(KK6)<-c("Week","Cluster","Motivation")
KK6$Week <- as.numeric(KK6$Week) 
KK6$Cluster <- as.factor(KK6$Cluster)
#MISS THIS PART IN THE BEGINNING: since "cluster" is not numeric but rather a categorical label we want to convert it from an "integer" format to a "factor" format !!!!!so that ggplot does not treat it as a number!!!!!!.
#draw the graph
ggplot(KK6,aes(x=Week,y=Motivation,color=Cluster))+
  geom_line()+
  xlab("Week")+
  ylab("Average Motivation")
```

```{r}
KK7<-table(KK4$Cluster)
KK7 # There are 7 students in cluster 1, 9 in cluster 2 and 7 in cluster 3.
#ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF Kmean2 AND Kmean3
var_k2<-K5%>%
  group_by(Cluster)%>%
  summarise(var(Motivation))%>%
  dplyr::select(2)
var_k3<-KK5%>%
  group_by(Cluster)%>%
  summarise(var(Motivation))%>%
  dplyr::select(2)
paste("Decide: 3 clusters is better/more informative than 2 cluters. Answer:",sum(var_k2)-sum(var_k3)>0)
```

##Part II
Combine the result to previous social network analysis, cluster the students, and then redraw the graph of the class but color the students according the cluster they are in.
```{r}
df<-read.csv("hudk4050-classes.csv")
#cleaning the data
#Tidying data by replacing all spaces and hyphens with ""
df<-do.call(cbind,lapply(df,function(x) toupper(gsub("\\s|-","",x))))
df<-data.frame(df)
df<-filter(df,df$First.Name!="ZIMO") #erase "ZIMO"'s dirty data
df<-unite(df,Full.Name,First.Name,Last.Name)
  
fit2<-kmodes(df,4) # kmodes clustering is for categorical value
df1<-data.frame(df,fit2$cluster) # join the assigned cluster to the original dataframe

#Creating a matrix for person-course
df2<-df%>%  
  gather(Class,Course,-Full.Name)%>%
  filter(Course!="")%>%
  dplyr:: select(1,3) # just keep the name and course 
#Adding column Count:"1" for spread and also to notice an existing value
df2$Count<-1
#a matrix for person-course
person_course<-spread(df2,Course,Count,fill=0)


#Creating a matrix for person_person
library(tibble)
person_course<-person_course %>%
  remove_rownames %>%
  column_to_rownames(var="Full.Name")

#a matrix for person_person
person_course<-as.matrix(person_course)
course_person<-t(person_course)
person_person_matrix<-person_course%*%course_person #matrix multiplication, this is a way to find out number of items in common


#Creating a grap from an adjacency matrix(person-person)
library(igraph)
g<-graph_from_adjacency_matrix(person_person_matrix,mode="directed",diag=FALSE)
plot(g,vertex.color=df1$fit2.cluster)
```

##Part III

In class activity 6 we clustered students in the class by the answers to a questionaire. Create a visualization that shows the overlap between these clusters and the clusters generated in part II.

```{r}
df_6<-read.csv("HUDK405019-clustering.csv",encoding ="UTF-8",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df_6<-df_6%>%
  unite(Full.Name,First.Name,Last.Name)
#Convert the index numbers of the data frame into the student names.
row.names(df_6) <- df_6$Full.Name
df_6$Full.Name <- NULL
#Wrangle data using dplyr to include only the numerical values.
#Remove location variables
df_7 <- dplyr::select(df_6, 1:11)
#Remove any characters
df_8<-lapply(df_7,function(x)gsub("[A-z]","",x))
df_8<-data.frame(df_8)
#Convert all variables to numeric
for (i in 1:dim(df_8)[2]){
  df_8[,i]<-as.numeric(as.character(df_8[,i])) 
  #changing from factor;need to convert it into character first
}
#Scale the data so that no variable has undue influence
df_8 <- data.frame(scale(df_8))
 
#Replace missing values with average score EG - zero
df_8 <- df_8 %>% mutate_all(funs(ifelse(is.na(.) == TRUE, 0, .)))
#Handling columns with latitues and longtitudes
df_9 <- dplyr::select(df_6, 13:14)

#Cleaning data using regx
#Change names for convenience
names(df_9) <- c("lattitude", "longitude")
#Remove any characters and common punctuation
df_9 <- df_9 %>% mutate_all(funs(gsub("[a-zA-Z]", "", .)))
df_9 <- df_9 %>% mutate_all(funs(sub("[?]", "", .)))
#Remove anything after the first non-numeric character in lattitude
df_9$lattitude <- sub(",.*$","", df_9$lattitude) 
df_9$lattitude <- sub("°.*$","", df_9$lattitude)
#Remove anything before the first non-numeric character in longitude
df_9$longitude <- gsub(".*,","",df_9$longitude)
df_9$longitude <- sub("°.*$","", df_9$longitude)
#Convert all variables to numeric
df_9 <- df_9 %>% mutate_all(funs(as.numeric(.)))
```

```{r}
# clustering
fit3<-kmeans(df_8,4)
fit3$cluster
df_10<-data.frame(df_8,df_9,fit3$cluster)

#graph created in activity 6
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df_10, aes(longitude, lattitude, color = as.factor(fit3.cluster))) +
  geom_point(size = 3)+
  labs(color='Clusters') +
  labs('CLuster and Geographic distribution')
```
Based on this this longtitude and latitude map, we could tell that students coming from the same place have more in common and are easily forming into clusters. To increase cultural exchange and activate classroom dynamics, it's better to have students from different clusters to team up for group work/ discussion.


```{r}
#combining two cluster together
Full.Name<-toupper(row.names(df_6))
df_10<-data.frame(Full.Name,df_10)
df_11<-inner_join(df_10,df1,by="Full.Name")
df_11$Full.Name<-as.factor(1:36)
#overlaying two ggplots
#diamond:cluster 1 based on questionnaire
#filled circle:cluster2 based on social network
ggplot(df_11,aes(x=Full.Name,y=fit3.cluster,color=as.factor(fit3.cluster)))+
  geom_point(size=5,pch=5)+
  geom_point(data=df_11,aes(x=Full.Name,y=fit2.cluster,color=as.factor(fit2.cluster)),size=5,pch=19)+
  xlab("Students")+
  ylab("Clusters")+
  labs(color='Diamond:Cluster1;Circle:Cluster2')
```
Comparing two clustering based on two different data sources: one: courses registered by students (categorical, kmodes); the other one: survey about past travelling history and geographical location(numeric, kmeans) But the plot won't actually tell us a lot, but offering us more grouping basis.
